# Random Number Generation #
SmileBASIC has a set of built-in random number generation functions.
Number generation has a number of applications in computer science,
so these features can be a useful tool if used properly.

## Generating Numbers ##
To generate random numbers, you must call the generator (or RNG)
with one of the following instructions.
### RND ###
`RND` returns a random integer that is greater than or equal to 0,
and less than a specified upper bound. For example, the function
`RND(5)` returns a random integer between 0 and 4.
