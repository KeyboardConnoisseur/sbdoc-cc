# EXP #
Return Euler's number raised to the given power.

## Description ##
`EXP` raises Euler's number, *e*, to the power specified. If no exponent is given,
the value of *e* is returned.

## Syntax ##
`EXP([exponent])`  
Returns the value of *e* exponentiated by `exponent`.  
If `exponent` is not passed, the constant *e* is returned.
This is equivalent to passing 1 as the exponent.  
The exact value of *e* returned is 2.7182818284590451.

## Examples ##
`PRINT EXP()`  
Print the mathematical constant *e*.

## Notes ##
`EXP()` performs nearly 3 times as fast when not given an argument, even if the argument is 1.
Thus, it may fold to a constant as `A#=EXP()` performs the same as `A#=2.718`.
It is possible that it simply doesn't perform calculation when not given an argument,
and *always* performs calculation when given an argument, even if it is 1.
However, if this explanation were true, it wouldn't account for the lack of calling overhead.
